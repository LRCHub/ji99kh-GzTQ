Well, the beer's on the bar, and the smoke fills the air
There's a fool in every corner, man, I just don't care
Tight pants, line dance, stetson hats, and cowboy boots
They got a Friday night, get right, honky tonk attitude

Well, the waitress never leaves you with a half-empty glass
And every girl's on the dance floor shakin' her... well
It's a two step, three step, outta step, country mood
They got a Friday night, get right, honky tonk attitude

Well now, everybody knows that's where everybody goes
Just to dance away their blues
So leave your cares behind, it's just a state of mind
What have you got to lose? Ah, yeah

Hey bartender, pour up another round
We're just get gettin' started, don't shut us down
We need a slow dance, romance, last chance rendezvous
We need a Friday night, get right, honky tonk attitude

Well now, everybody knows that's where everybody goes
Just to dance away their blues
So leave your cares behind, it's just a state of mind
What have you got to lose?
What have you got to lose?

Ah, shake it now

Hey bartender, pour up another round
We're just get gettin' started, don't shut us down
We need a slow dance, romance, last chance rendezvous
We need a Friday night, get right, honky tonk attitude

Well now, everybody knows that's where everybody goes
Just to dance away their blues
So leave your cares behind, it's just a state of mind
What have you got to lose?
Oh, what have you got to lose?

If you've got a Friday night, get right, honky tonk attitude
Yeah, you need a Friday night, get right, honky tonk attitude
Wow, wow
