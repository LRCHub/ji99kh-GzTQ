You wish it was sunny,
But it's not... hahaha
The sun will come out
The day after tomorrow.haha
And you can move on
To another bad day
You wish you were pretty,
But you're not... hahaha
But your baby loves you,
He tells you so all the time
Oh that must be why
You're so happy together
You're having another bad day
And that's all you could change
But you don't,
But your attitude, baby
Doesn't have to be so sad
You wish you were happy
But you're not.hahahaha
But if life was easy
You wouldn't learn anything,
Now would you?
But most of the lessons you learn
You would rather forget
You wish you could laugh it away
But its hard
A smoke or a drink makes
The laughing part easier, haha
But now you are stuck
With another addiction
You're having another bad day
And that's all you could change
You could change
But you're attitude, baby
Doesn't have to be so mad
If you were just younger, hahaha
Or, you could start over,
It's never too late,
That's what betty says
Whatever happened
To your sense of humor?
You've had all your treats
And its only 8: 30 am
That's am you would
Give anything to change back
To when
The waves
Were smaller
And you could jump
Over
Change back
To when you laughed
Easy
And all your moves
Were childlike
