(A. Moody)

Brothers and sisters, yeah
Got no kicking like this, boy
Brothers and sisters
One, two, three, swing it

Talking 'bout A double-T I T U D E
It's the groove that gets you next to me
When you're rocking and you're clocking
With a girl named D
Turn it up, the nasty beat
Get into it, move your feet
It's the fashion with attraction, the attitude
So swing it for me

Attitude
Just do it, do it, do it like this attitude
Attitude
Attitude, brothers and sisters
Here we go, here we go

I don't play no games and don't do drugs, no
Don't do things I will feel guilty for, no
I'm just into having a good time
You can keep that attitude, I'll keep mine

If you want to groove me, brothers and sisters
Pick up on this
Show me your best
Try and pass the test
If you want to move me, brothers and sisters
Pick up on this
Play it cool
Do it smooth
Yo, bust a move, bothers and sisters

Attitude, brothers and sisters
Just do it with attitude
Attitude, brothers and sisters
One, two, one, two, here

Here is something to think about
I don't have time to scream or shout
I'm just telling you what to do
When you've lost your cool
Show them that you ain't no joke
Keep the faith and then you'll smoke them
On the positive tip, come on, girl
Now play

Groove
Attitude
Attitude
Brothers and sisters
Groove, here we go, groove
Groove, here we go, groove
Brothers and sisters
Groove, here we go, do it, groove
Groove, do it, groove, do it, do it

If you want to groove me, brothers and sisters
Pick up on this
Show me your best, show me you're the best
Try and pass the test
If you want to move me, brothers and sisters
Pick up on this
Play it cool
Do it smooth
Yo, bust a move

Attitude
Just do it, do it, do it, do it like this attitude
Attitude
Brothers and sisters, attitude

It's time, time, time to get smooth, if you want to
Attitude it's the way you dress, smooth
Some people use it just to impress
Not me, I use it positively, smooth
To keep me moving to the master beat
It's time to break it down together, smooth
Moving your body, your feet or whatever, if you want to
Do it with the attitude, smooth
Now it's time to get smooth

Do it like this
Attitude, do it, do it, do it
Just do it, do it, do it, do it, attitude
Attitude
Swing it, swing it, swing

If you want to move me, brothers and sisters
Yeah, yeah, swing it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Swing it, hit me, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, swing it

If you want to move me
Swing it, brothers and sisters
