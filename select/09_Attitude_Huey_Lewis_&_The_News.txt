I don't need no money, cause I've got attitude
Enough to show you a good time, honey
And that's what I'm about to do
You found your diamond in the rough, baby
And I'm about to tell you why.

'Cause I got everything
That attitude can buy
I can get you anything
That attitude can buy.

Cruising down the avenue
Styling in my new suit
Foot on the accelerator
See you later
I got everything that attitude can buy.

Cut in lines at the night clubs
All the doormen let me slide
I get the very best table by the bandstand
They play my favorite song as soon as I arrive
Treat all the ladies like ladies
They know I'm an up-and-up guy.

'Cause I got everything
That attitude can buy
I can get you anything
That attitude can buy.

Rapping to the young men
It's kinda hard to understand
Got a pair of alligators, see you later
I got everything that attitude can buy... horns

I got everything that attitude can buy
I can get you anything that attitude can buy
Talking on my car phone
Send and send 'til you get home
Meet me at the elevator, see you later.

'Cause I got everything
That attitude can buy
I can get you anything
That attitude can buy.

'Cause I got everything
That attitude can buy
I can get you anything
That attitude can buy.

Whoa yea!
