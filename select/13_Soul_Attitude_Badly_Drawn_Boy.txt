Does it have to be modern love
Velvet glove
Then you ask me to go so low
Just give me your attitude soul
How could I be so low
Just give me your attitude soul
Does it have to be modern love
The hug of your hand in my glove
I could be kissing the nape of your neck
Drink down a glass of my sweat
How could I be so low
Just give me your attitude soul
Temperature starts to kick in
I feel the sole of your feet on my chin
Then you ask me 'how low will you go?'
Then you tell me I'm flying low
Then you ask me to go so low
Just give me your attitude soul
How could I be so low
Just give me your attitude soul
Does it have to be modern love
Velvet glove
